# Health Care Portal 🏥

**Design Capstone Project | School of Computer Science and Engineering, XIM University**

The **Health Care Portal** is a web-based application designed to bridge the information gap between patients and healthcare providers. In today's fragmented healthcare landscape, finding reliable information about hospitals, specific treatments, and costs can be challenging[cite: 14, 27]. [cite_start]This project aggregates this data into a user-friendly platform, empowering users to make informed decisions about their healthcare.
